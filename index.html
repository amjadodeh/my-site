        <h3>Hello, I'm Amjad Odeh.</h3>
        <article>
          <p>I'm a Web Developer from Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
          <p>I'm new to this (if this website doesn't make that obvious enough) and I wouldn't even call myself a developer yet but thats what I am supposed to do apparently (according to this web dev course) so... yeah.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            I like to make things and I hope Web Development will give me the skills I need to take it to the next step. It's not very often I work on projects with others but when I do, I never regret it. There is always more efficient methods to create and ideas that have never crossed my mind. But like I said Web Development is what is going to help me take my creative endeavors to the next step.

      i was addicted to <br>, 
      but to be fair it kinda worked... 
      i know... i should've fixed the spacing problem at its roots.
      i searched it up and nothing else worked so uhhh... (<br>)
      i'm going to ask my mentor for a better way of fixing the spacing next time we meet.
