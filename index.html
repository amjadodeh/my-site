       <p class="hello"><b>Hello, I'm Amjad Odeh.</b></p>
       <p>I'm a Web Developer from Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
       <p>I'm new to this (if this website doesn't make that obvious enough) but I believe I can become an exeptional Web Developer soon. I'm pationate, hard-working, creative, a good leader, and I'm able to think outside the box to find the solution. But most importantly, I love to create new things so thats what I do.</p>
       <p>I love the internet. I guess we all do but most people like internet for its resourcefulness. I see it as the perfect platform to share my creations and ideas with the world to make the world a better place for everyone. </p>

       <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>Web Devepopment has given me great creative freedom which I need but I realize this isn't something I can do alone as my ideas and creations can always improve and I can't expect myself to think of every good idea. I've discovered through working on projects with others that I'm a good leader and a great planner. I'm not afraid to ask questions to understand the concept and I'm willing to give others my time and attention to accomplish our task. I guess this is something I've developed though skateboarding because I could never expect to learn a trick without understanding the exact movements I needed to do. I learned important strategies I use to this day to learn and share ideas and concepts. List of services you can (or want to) provide a client.</p>
