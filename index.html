        <h2>About</h2>
        <!-- <p>
          First and foremost, I'm a Muslim. I am originally from a small village
          in Palestine but I have spent most of my life in the states. As a
          Muslim, I believe the purpose of life is profound, yet simple: to
          worship Allah (God), i.e., to strive to bring all aspects of the inner
          and outer self to complete conformity to what God has commanded. Life
          is short and I don't intend to waste it. To be frank, I don't believe
          God put me on this earth to sit around and watch youtube all day. I
          believe I am meant to be an exceptional man, and becoming that
          requires courage, creativity, and, most importantly, daily action, not
          vain hopes. I believe objective morality only comes from God, and that
          the laws put in place by God are final and irrefutable.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to health, I believe in being physically fit, for the
          benefit of not only a strong body but a strong mind. I also believe
          that in being confident in ones own abilty in unarmed combat and have
          trained in Muay Thai, BJJ, Wrestling, and Boxing, developing my own
          unique style along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, I am a very positive and peaceful person. I like to
          make others laugh to lighten the mood and raise spirits. I truly
          believe that smiling is one of the most powerful expressions of warmth
          and affection and I strive to always smile to those I hold dear. I
          believe in avoiding argumentation except in the context of a formal
          debate. I believe in privacy, especially in family matters, and do not
          involve myself in anything that doesn't concern me. I am very
          dedicated to maintaining good relations with relatives and those I
          hold dear. I believe in having a peaceful home filled with love and
          joy.

          Life is a test, and sometimes the hardest part is the uncertainty of
          what's next. It's the challenge of moving forward without knowing
          exactly where the path leads. I don't know the future, but with each
          step forward, I become more prepared for it. That said, some things
          you just know, so clearly, like hints of fate.
