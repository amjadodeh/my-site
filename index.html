          <p class="hello"><b>Hello, I'm Amjad Odeh.</b></p>
          <p>I'm a Software Engineer from Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
          <p>
            I am skilled in writing clean, practical, and tested code to create
            and deploy mobile-first responsive applications through test-driven
            development. I've worked extensively on the front-end with React and
            jQuery, ensuring that data from APIs render quickly and efficiently.
            I have developed complex APIs using Node.js with clean, readable,
            and tested code.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate, hard-working, creative, and I'm able to think
            outside the box to find the solution. But most importantly, I love
            to create new things, so that's what I do.
          </p>

          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I love the internet. I guess we all do, but most people like the
            internet for its resourcefulness. I see it as the perfect platform
            to share my creations and ideas with the world to programmatically
            make the world a better place for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Software Development has given me great creative freedom, but I
            realize this isn't something I can do alone as there is always room
            for improvement, and I can't expect to think of every good idea
            myself. Through working on projects with others, I've discovered
            that I'm a great problem solver, and I'm not afraid to ask
            questions. I'm always willing to give others my time and attention
            to accomplish our tasks. I guess this is something I've developed
            through skateboarding because I could never expect to land a trick
            without understanding the exact movements I needed to do. I acquired
            essential tactics that I use to this day to learn and share new
            ideas and concepts.
